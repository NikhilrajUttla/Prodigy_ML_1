<h1> Prodigy_ML_1</h1>
I have implemented a linear regression model for house price prediction based on Task-01: "Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms." 
The goal was to find the best-fit line (regression line) that predicts the house prices (dependent variable) based on the features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms (independent variables).

<h1> Dataset Used</h1>
here is the link that refers to our Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

<h1> Knowledge acquired </h1>
1.Efficient Data Loading and Usage: Learned the importance of focusing on the correct dataset (train.csv) to ensure that the features and target variables used for training and evaluation are accurate. 
Handling Multiple Data Sources: Gained insight into the practical implications of loading multiple datasets and the need to correctly use the intended dataset for analysis.<br>

2.Feature Engineering: Applied skills in selecting relevant features (LotArea, BsmtFullBath, BsmtHalfBath, FullBath, HalfBath, BedroomAbvGr, TotRmsAbvGrd) that are predictive of house prices.
Data Preparation: Understood the importance of preparing and preprocessing data to be used effectively in a machine learning model.

3.Linear Regression Implementation: Implemented a linear regression model using scikit-learn, learning how to fit the model to the training data and make predictions. 
Performance Metrics: Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics to understand prediction accuracy and model fit.

4.Data Visualization and Interpretation: Developed skills in creating scatter plots to visualize the relationship between actual and predicted house prices.
Perfect Prediction Line: Learned to include a reference line in the plot to indicate the ideal prediction scenario, enhancing the interpretation of model performance.

5.Model Evaluation and Improvement: Gained experience in analyzing model performance and understanding the implications of evaluation metrics on model quality. Visualization Insights: Used visualizations to gain insights into how well the model is predicting and identify potential areas for improvement. 
This task provided hands-on experience with key machine learning concepts, including data handling, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and visualization, crucial for developing and assessing predictive models.
